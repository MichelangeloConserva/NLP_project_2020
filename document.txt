 A small marble sign lies in front of the entrance of the dungeon. You 
    begin to read it...
    You are about to enter a vast dungeon with lynx as far as the eye can see. 
    Your path will require great courage: terrifying monsters live in the dungeon behind this majestic door. 
    Their nutrition consists mostly of ochies and humans.
    Further, nature will not always be on your side: strong winds will slow down your journey; 
    shifting weather will modify the effectiveness of your weapons. 
    Dangerously big plants will have to be avoided.
    Twisted trails with the constant threat of landfalls will have you always one step 
    closer to death. 
    No need to be discouraged though! You can bring weapons with you young hero. Choose among 
    the weapons next to this sign. You must make this choice carefully. Itâ€™s a matter of 
    life and death! 
    Go on to your adventure now and remember to bring a snack.
